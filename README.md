# LearnableTransformsNO

This repository contains the code for the paper: "How important are specialized transforms in Neural Operators?" accepted at Synergy of Scientific and Machine Learning Modeling Workshop, colocated with International Conference for Machine Learning (ICML 2023).

This repository is largely adapted from 
1) https://github.com/neuraloperator/neuraloperator/tree/master (Fourier Neural Operator)
2) https://github.com/TapasTripura/Wavelet-Neural-Operator-for-pdes (Wavelet Neural Operator)
3) https://github.com/lu-group/deeponet-fno

The datasets used in the paper can be found at:
- [PDE datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UnbQh2WWc6knEHbLn-ZaXrKUZhp7pjt-?usp=sharing)

Additional Codes to be uploaded soon:
1. Comparison with examples from Geometric FNO paper.
2. Comparison with examples from PINO paper.
3. Diffusion Sampling (Looking for collaborations)
4. FourCastNet  (Looking for collaborations)
